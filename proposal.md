# Catch Them Strawberry!
https://github.com/kiaramontinola/final-project
## Repository


## Description
My final project is an interactive game where the user moves arrow keys to drag a basket across to catch the falling objects. This game would generate strawberries
to fall from the sky and the user scores a point when they catch them in their basket.

## Features
- Random Strawberries to Fall
	- Using the concepts learned from the digital rain lab, the program would gradually generate random strawberries to fall
- User Interaction
	- Using the pygame keys from the pygame library, the user will be able to interact with the game at the touch of their arrow keys
- Point Tracking
	- Using a while loop, points will be added for every strawberry the user catches in their basket

## Challenges
- How to gradually increment the strawberries to fall
- How to create/ import a backdrop

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
The ideal outcome is a fully-operational and interactive game that is full of colors, not just a white background. I want to pay homage
to one of my favorite shows growing up, Strawberry Shortcake.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- THe minimal viable outcome would be a simple interactive game in which the user is able to move the basket to catch the strawberries.
## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Set up basic game logic
  2. Execute basic while loop for point counter

- Week 2
  1. Design graphics/ backdrop
  2. Design basket

- Week N (Final)
  1. Add aditional details/graphics/characters
  2. Finalize/ debug
