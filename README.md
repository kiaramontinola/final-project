# Final Project: Catch Them Strawberry! Game

This game is a tribute to one of my favorite shows, Strawberry Shortcake. The player in this case, is Strawberry Shortcake herself- hence, the name of the game. The objective is to catch as many falling strawberries in the basket as possible.

The game features a landing page where the user is able to click play in order to start the game.
Once the user clicks the play button, the game executes and the strawberries start to fall randomly. The player is able to move the basket horizontally using the left and right arrow keys on their keyboard. A score is kept that appears at the top left of the screen while the game is running. Every strawberry that is caught in the basket triggers a sound effect and adds 1 point to the score. 
To exit the game, the player is able to click the "EXIT GAME" button
